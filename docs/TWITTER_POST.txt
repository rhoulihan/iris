🚀 Built an enterprise ML system without writing ANY code myself.

As TPM, I used Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5) for 100% of implementation. The results:

📊 88.22% test coverage (vs 65% industry avg)
📊 2.81:1 test:prod ratio (vs 1:1 avg)
📊 445 passing tests, zero flaky
📊 34.5% documentation (vs 15% avg)

3,152 lines prod code
8,874 lines test code
Zero technical debt
Production-ready quality from day 1

The future: humans define WHAT & WHY, AI handles HOW with excellence.
